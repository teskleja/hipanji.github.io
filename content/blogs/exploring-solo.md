Every Saturday and Sunday, my little son, my wife, and I have developed a new habit of embarking on morning walks through the vibrant streets of Solo. This enchanting city, also known as Solo, offers a delightful ambiance that we have come to cherish. Although the weather can be a tad scorching at times, I anticipate a decline in temperature as we approach the month of June. 

One of the most captivating aspects that immediately catches my attention is the pedestrian infrastructure. The city has invested in well-maintained walkways adorned with beautiful trees, offering a respite from the sun's intense rays. As we stroll along these pathways, a sense of tranquility envelops us. However, amidst the serene pedestrian zones, we often encounter the occasional disruption caused by motorcycles brazenly zooming through these designated areas. Such occurrences force us to sidestep and make way for these impromptu motorists.

Coincidentally, our walks coincide with the upcoming Waisak day celebration. The decorations surrounding Gladak, a prominent neighborhood in Solo, emanate an ethereal aura of festivity, with vibrant temples and symbols that honor the sacred day. It's truly a remarkable sight, fostering a sense of connection between the city and the auspicious occasion.

Our walks usually span over 5000 steps, which is a great way for our family to kickstart a healthier lifestyle. Given that we don't engage in much exercise, this routine is a welcomed change. After our invigorating walk, we often find ourselves craving a satisfying breakfast. To satiate our appetites, we head towards the nearest food establishments, be it a familiar McDonald's or a crispy KFC joint. I know we should be conscious of burning calories, but indulging in a hearty breakfast now and then brings us immeasurable joy.

Solo, with its efficient public transportation system and amiable locals, has truly captured our hearts. The city boasts a network of buses, taxis, and trains that make commuting a breeze. The residents we encounter during our walks greet us with warm smiles, reinforcing the city's reputation for hospitality. However, if there's one thing I wish for Solo, it is an abundance of trees. While the pedestrian pathways provide shade, the addition of more trees would enhance the city's greenery and further contribute to the aesthetic appeal.

This city fortunately has proven to be a delightful destination for both residents and visitors alike. Its walkable streets, though occasionally marred by motorbikes, offer an inviting space to explore the city's hidden gems. The upcoming Waisak day celebrations and the city's commitment to public transportation only add to its charm. As my family and I continue our weekend tradition, we are grateful for the opportunity to witness Solo's beauty unfold with every step we take.
